# rust-kata-machine

I will be translating the problems from The Primeagen's The Last Algorithms Course You'll Ever Need, from Typescript to Rust.
Implementations will occur over several versions. Version 1 will focus on problem translation, variable implementation
and testing. This will allow users to fork this repo and have fun, if they so desire. Version 2 would ideally be a cargo
repo, where the variables are abstracted away from the user.
